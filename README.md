LOD-Based Similarity for Semantic Web Services

In this project we check whether two Semantic Web Services are similar, and
therefore substitutable, or if there is a relationship of composition between them. 

The main approach is look up the Input and Output concepts of each of the two OWL files 
in the provided ontology and then try to match them
